Part 1
Time Complexity of the below functions in Big Thetaform.

a) T(n) = 3T (n/2) + n			is	T ε ϴ (n^log 3)

b) T(n) = 64T (n/8) - n^2(log n)	is	T ε ϴ (n^2 log n)

c) T(n) = 2nT (n/2) + n^n		is	T ε ϴ (n^k log n) where k > 0

d) T(n) = 3T (n/3) + n/2		is	T ε ϴ (n log n)

e) T(n) = 7T (n/3) + n^2		is	T ε ϴ (n^2)
